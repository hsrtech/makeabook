              <h2>What’s new changed in Bootstrap 4?</h2>
              <p>Lets take a quick look at whats added, or changed in Bootstrap 4, so far. There may be some more changes by the time we get final release of Bootstrap 4, but most of them are already being implemented.</p>
              <h3>Moved from Less to Sass</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap 4 is using Sass as its CSS pre-processor, instead of Less used in previous versions. Sass is faster in compilation, and have a bigger community then Less.</p>

              <h3>Improved Grid System</h3>
              <p>Grid system is improved to provide better support for mobile devices.</p>

              <h3>Opt-In Flexbox support</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap now allow you-to use flexbox, just by changing a variables value in Sass file. Flexbox is now fully supported by all modern web browsers. In Internet Explorer, its supported from version 10 onwards.</p>

              <h3>Dropped wells, thumbnails, and panels for cards</h3>
              <p>A new component “Cards”, has replaced old components: wells, thumbnails, and panels.</p>

              <h3>Introduced Reboot</h3>
              <p>In previous version Bootstrap was using Normalize.css, they have now extended normalize.css and created their own version called reboot.css, reboot is designed specially to meet requirements of bootstrap users.</p>

              <h3>Customization options</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap 4 allow lots of customization with help of variables in Sass. For example you can change value of rounded corners everywhere, by just changing one variable’s value in Sass, and recompile it.</p>

              <h3>Dropped IE8 Support</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap 4 had dropped support for Internet Explorer 8, because of its lack for CSS3 features.</p>

              <h3>Moved to rem and em units</h3>
              <p>Pixels have been swapped for rems and ems where appropriate, to make responsive typography and component sizing easier.</p>

              <h3>All JavaScript plugins are rewritten</h3>
              <p>All JavaScript plugins in bootstrap 4 are rewritten using latest EcmaScript 6 standards, with lots of improvements.</p>

              <h3>Improved auto positioning of tooltips, and popovers</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap 4 is utilizing another JS library called “Tether” for improving auto positioning of tooltips, and popovers.</p>

              <h3>Dropped Glyphicons</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap has dropped support for Glyphicons, because most people are using font awesome instead of glyphicons. A discussion is going on to add or not to add support for other icon fonts in upcoming versions. </p>

              <h3>Improved styling of form elements</h3>
              <p>WTF Forms, are now integrated directly inside Bootstrap 4, making forms more beautiful, and cross browser consistent.</p>

              <h3>Modular Architecture / Components</h3>

              <p>New utility classes are added. They’re designed to reduce the frequency of highly repetitive declarations in your CSS.</p>
